## BARTSIGNS

This project uses the Bay Area Rapid Transit public api to retrieve and display estimated train departure times.  The signs are styled to look like the displays seen at BART stations across the bay, using CSS to imitate the sign design and LED glow effects.  The information is seamlessly updated live with current train information if left open for an extended period of time.
